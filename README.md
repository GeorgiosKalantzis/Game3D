# Game3D

# That game respents a simulator of a field of fight !! Unfortunately , I have attached only the scripts due to capacity scarcity , but anyone can exploit these scripts and with the appropiate attachment of these into two characters can build a very nice game and consequently utilize these ideas into complex and professional games !!

 A lot of advanced ideas are implemented here !! Such as application of artificial intellegence , in particular the scripts AI_Enemy , LineSight and Health are implementig the AI of the game. Moreover the script SaveLoad constitutes a JSON implementation and the Inventory and InventoryScript, in conjuction with the use of events, are creating a cool inventory into your game ! 
 
 I hope this explanantion is helpful in order to understand the workflow of the code !
